# What is a cartoonified image?
A cartoonified image is an image that has been processed to look like a cartoon or illustration. This is achieved by applying various image processing techniques to the original image, such as edge detection, color quantization, and bilateral filtering. The result is an image that has a stylized, cartoon-like appearance.
